## Goal of the Course
The aim of the course is to provide participants with basic theoretical knowledge of the methods of Computer Vision and an introduction to the main application areas. The course will be based on practical demonstrations and exercises to involve participants and at the same time increase their skills on the topics covered.
## Prerequisites
Adequate knowledge of Python programming language. In addition, basic theoretical knowledge of image processing, algebra (vectors, matrices, etc.), and machine learning techniques.

## Course Outline
1. Introduction to Computer Vision (3h)
  -	AI and ML recalls
  -	Digital images recalls
  - Exercise (open, visualize, image properties) Numpy + OpenCv
  -	What is Computer vision
    	Practical examples 
2.	Image/Video classification and retrieval (3h)
  -	Image classification
  -	Supervised vs Unsupervised 
  -	Binary vs. Multi-label classification
  -	Video classification
3. Semantic segmentation (3h)
  -	Definition

4.	Object detection (3h)
  - Object Detection vs semantic segmentation
  - Object detection (viola-jones, histogram of oriented gradients, CNNs)
  - Practical examples (face detection)
  - Alignment
  - Practical examples (generic object alignment + face alignment)
  - Classification (handcrafted features, holistic methods, CNNs)
